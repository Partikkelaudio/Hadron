- Moved csound~_orig to Desktop temporarily:
Same error.

Sluttanker: 
 - Vurdere å innstallere Xcode på nytt uten iOS-support?
 - Søk opp "...dependency graph" igjen
 - Søk opp "Cannot find executable..." igjen
 
 
 17.03.2011 - later
 
 - Opened Contents->Info.plist inside csound~.mxo (Double release build with linking to original framework) and changed executable from csound~_hadron to csound~. Must have forgotten to set back somewhere in Xcode
 
 - Compiling double release version again with Hadron Csound framework: Worked!
 
 - Compiling double release Hadron version again renamed to csound~_hadron: Not working (csound~_hadron showing as an jbogus object)
 
 - Searching Xcode project for reference to "csound~": Found two string variables and changed them from csound~ to csound~_hadron. 
 
 - Compiling double release Hadron version again: Worked!
 
 csound~_hadron 1.1.0 build complete!
