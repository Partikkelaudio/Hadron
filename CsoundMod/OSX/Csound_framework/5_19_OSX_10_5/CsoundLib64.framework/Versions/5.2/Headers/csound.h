 *
 * Csound is a unit generator-based, user-programmable, user-extensible computer music system.
 * It was originally written by Barry Vercoe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984
 * as the first C language version of this type of software. Since then Csound has received
 * numerous contributions from researchers, programmers, and musicians from around the world.
 *
 * CsoundAC is a Python extension module for doing algorithmic composition, in one which one
 * writes music by programming in Python. Musical events are points in music space with
 * dimensions {time, duration, event type, instrument, pitch as MIDI key, loudness as MIDI
 * velocity, phase, pan, depth, height, pitch-class set, 1}, and pieces are composed by
 * assembling a hierarchical tree of nodes in music space. Each node has its own local
 * transformation of coordinates in music space. Nodes can be empty, contain scores or
 * fragments of scores, generate scores, or transform scores. CsoundAC also contains a Python
 * interface to the Csound API, making it easy to render CsoundAC compositions using Csound.

 * \section section_api_outline Outline of the API
 *
 * \subsection section_api_apilist The Csound Application Programming Interfaces
 *
 * The Csound Application Programming Interface (API) reference is contained herein.
 * The Csound API actually consists of several APIs:
 *
 * - The basic Csound C API. Include csound.h and link with libcsound.a.
 *   This also includes the Cscore API (see below).
 * - The basic Csound C++ API. Include csound.hpp and link with libcsound.a.
 * - The extended Csound C++ API. Include CppSound.hpp and link with
 *   libcsound.a and libcsnd.a,
 *   which adds to the Csound C++ API a CsoundFile class for loading, saving,
 *   and editing Csound orchestra and score files.
 * - The CsoundAC C++ API. Include CsoundAC.hpp and link with libcsound.a,
 *   libcsnd.a, and libCsoundAC.a.
 *   The CsoundAC class contains an instance of the CppSound class,
 *   and provides a class hierarchy for doing algorithmic composition using
 *   Michael Gogins' concept of music graphs (previously known as Silence).
 * - The Csound Python API. Import the csnd Python extension module.
 *   This provides a complete Python wrapper for csound.hpp, CppSound,
 *   and CsoundFile. The Python API provides a complete Python wrapper
 *   for the entire Csound C++ API,
 *   and the Csound C++ API reference also serves as a reference to the Python API.
 * - The CsoundAC Python API. Import the CsoundAC Python extension module.
 *   The Python API provides a complete Python wrapper
 *   for the entire CsoundAC C++ API, including Silence, and the CsoundAC
 *   C++ API reference also serves as a reference to the Python API.
 * - An experimental LISP API.
 *
 * \section section_api_c_example An Example Using the Csound API
 *
 * The Csound command--line program is itself built using the Csound API.
 * Its code reads as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * #include "csound.h"
 *
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   // Create Csound.
 *   void *csound = csoundCreate(0);
 *   // One complete compile/perform cycle.
 *   int result = csoundCompile(csound, argc, argv);
 *   if(!result) {
 *     while(csoundPerformKsmps(csound) == 0){}
 *     csoundCleanup(csound);
 *   }
 *   // Destroy Csound.
 *   csoundDestroy(csound);
 *   return result;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section section_api_example_cpp The CsoundAC C++ API
 *
 * CsoundAC extends the Csound API with C++. There is a C++ class for the Csound API proper (CppSound),
 * another C++ class (CsoundFile) for manipulating Csound files in code, and additional classes for
 * algorithmic composition based on music space. All these C++ classes also have a
 * Python interface in the CsoundAC Python extension module.
 *
 * You can build CsoundAC into your own software using the CsoundAC shared library and
 * CsoundAC.hpp header file.
 *
 * \section section_api_cscore Cscore
 *
 * Beginning with Csound 5, all of the Cscore functions described in the
 * manual are now part of the Csound API, and they can be called from a program
 * that calls the Csound library.
 *
 * All of the CScore functions are renamed in the Csound API. For example, createv() is now
 * cscoreCreateEvent(), and lcopy() is now cscoreListCopy().  In addition, each
 * function takes an additional first parameter that is a pointer to a CSOUND
 * instance.  You can find the details in the header file, cscore.h, which may
 * be included with your Csound distribution, or if not, can be found in Csound CVS
 *`on SourceForge.
 *
 * Before you can use any of the Cscore API functions, you must create a CSOUND
 * instance and initialize Cscore by calling csoundInitializeCscore() -- see
 * csound.h for an explanation.  An example main program that does all of this
 * Top/cscormai.c.  You should add a function called cscore() with your own
 * score-processing code.  An example that does nothing except write the score
 * back out unchanged can be found in the file Top/cscore_internal.c.
 *
 * To create your own standalone Cscore program, you must compile cscormai.c
 * (or your own main program) and the file containing your
 * cscore() function, and link them with the Csound API library.
 *
 * Everything that can be done using C as in the above examples can also be done
 * in a similar manner in Python or any of the other Csound API languages.
 *
 * \file
 *
 * \brief Declares the public Csound application programming interface (API).
 * \author John P. ffitch, Michael Gogins, Matt Ingalls, John D. Ramsdell,
 *         Istvan Varga and Victor Lazzarini
 *
 * \b Purposes
 *
 * The purposes of the Csound API are as follows:
 *
 * \li Declare a stable public application programming interface (API)
 *     for Csound in csound.h. This is the only header file that needs
 *     to be \#included by users of the Csound API.
 *
 * \li Hide the internal implementation details of Csound from users of
 *     the API, so that development of Csound can proceed without affecting
 *     code that uses the API.
 *
 * \b Users
 *
 * Users of the Csound API fall into two main categories: hosts, and plugins.
 *
 * \li Hosts are applications that use Csound as a software synthesis engine.
 *     Hosts can link with the Csound API either statically or dynamically.
 *
 * \li Plugins are shared libraries loaded by Csound at run time to implement
 *     external opcodes and/or drivers for audio or MIDI input and output.
 *
 * Hosts using the Csound API must \#include <csound.h>, and link with the
 * Csound API library. Plugin libraries should \#include <csdl.h> to get
 * access to the API function pointers in the CSOUND structure, and do not
 * need to link with the Csound API library.
 * Only one of csound.h and csdl.h may be included by a compilation unit.
 *
 * Hosts must first create an instance of Csound using the \c csoundCreate
 * API function. When hosts are finished using Csound, they must destroy the
 * instance of csound using the \c csoundDestroy API function.
 * Most of the other Csound API functions take the Csound instance as their
 * first argument.
 * Hosts can only call the standalone API functions declared in csound.h.
 *
 * Here is the complete code for the simplest possible Csound API host,
 * a command-line Csound application:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * #include <csound.h>
 *
 * int main(int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *     CSOUND *csound = csoundCreate(NULL);
 *     int result = csoundCompile(csound, argc, argv);
 *     if (!result)
 *       result = csoundPerform(csound);
 *     csoundDestroy(csound);
 *     return (result >= 0 ? 0 : result);
 * }
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * All opcodes, including plugins, receive a pointer to their host
 * instance of Csound as the first argument. Therefore, plugins MUST NOT
 * compile, perform, or destroy the host instance of Csound, and MUST call
 * the Csound API function pointers off the Csound instance pointer.
 *
 * \code
 * MYFLT sr = csound->GetSr(csound);
 * \endcode
 *
 * In general, plugins should ONLY access Csound functionality through the
 * API function pointers and public members of the CSOUND structure.
