* a separate opcode that can read out the current mask index
	- for wave masking, channelmaskin etc
	- this can be useful for synchronizing the masking sequences with an external process
	- discovered during generation of wave source amp display signals
** and: a separate opcode to reset the mask indices

* panning law for channel masking
	- e.g. channel 0 and 1 is used for dryL and dryR
	- a channel mask of 0.7 should give an amp of 0.707 for both ch0 and ch1
	- option to set channel mask mapping table?
		- for each channel transition
			0 to 1 map
			1 to 2 map
			etc
			8 to 1 map (for round pan)
