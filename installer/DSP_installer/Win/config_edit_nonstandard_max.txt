You Max directory could not be found in the standard location.
Hadron will still need to be installed in it's standard location C:/Program Files/Hadron.
(Program Files may be in your native language, or it might be appended by (x86) if you're on windows 7)

Due to this you will need to do a few configuration steps manually:

1.
Look in the Hadron install dir (C:/Program Files/Hadron.) and find the file "HadronConfig.txt",
edit the pathWIN= line so it says
 pathWIN=C:/Program Files/Hadron/

Don't delete the other lines, the config file still needs them.
It may look like this now:

pathWIN=C:/Program Files/Hadron/
pathOSX=
debug=0
debugToConsole=0

Save the file

If your Program Files directory has another name, e.g. "Program Files (x86)", you should use that name in the config file above.

2.
Copy this file to the Hadron directory in your Live Library (Live8Library\Presets\Audio Effects\Max Audio Effect\PartikkelAudio\Hadron)

If you have trouble finding the path to this directory, you can open Live and locate the Hadron for Live device (in Live Devices/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effect/PartikkelAudio/Hadron), right click on the device name in the device browser in Live and select "Show in Explorer".

3:
Also copy the same file to the Hadron(instrument) folder, similar to what just you did under 2) above, but now you copy to Live8Library\Presets\Instruments\Max Instrument\PartikkelAudio\Hadron

Thanks for your patience, and we hope you bear with us for the slightly nonstandard installation procedure in your case.
 Let us know how it works out.
